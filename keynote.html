  <p class="body"><strong>Professor Andre Lee, Ph.D.</strong>  Dr. Lee is currently a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the Michigan State University.  He received his Ph.D. degree in Physics/Materials Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1987.  From 1987 to 1989, Dr. Lee worked at the Polymers Division of NIST as a physical scientist where his research included physical aging of polymeric materials and viscoelastic properties characterization using optical methods.  In 1989, he joins the Composite Development Center of Lockheed Corporation as a Senior Scientist to work on carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites for the YF-22 project. He was responsible developing techniques for real-time monitoring of the consolidation processes in thermoplastics polymer matrix composites.  In 1991, he started the academic research in the area of polymeric matrix composite at Michigan State University.  In the past 24 years, his major research activities included the synthesis, manufacturing/processing and characterization of polymers and polymeric matrix composites, the use of nanostructured chemicals to manipulate microstructures of polymers and metals.  He is an expert in the area of design and synthesis of nanostructures to control the solidification events in solids.  Professor Lee has more than 60 published papers, and over 100 national/international presentations. His research group is currently funded by Air Force Research Laboratory, Ford Motor Company, National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research and Semiconductor Research Corporation.  </p>

  <p class="body">Dina Fattakhova-Rohlfing has obtained her education in chemistry at the Kazan State University, and has completed her Ph.D. degree in electrochemistry at the A. Arbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry in Kazan, Russian Federation in 1994. She worked afterward as a research scientist in academic institutes in Prague (J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry), Bordeaux (National School of Chemistry and Physics), and Hannover (University of Hannover). Since 2006 she works as a lecturer and since 2012 as a professor for the international master’s program Advanced Materials Science (AMS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich (LMU), Germany. She works in an interdisciplinary field combining electrochemistry and materials chemistry. Her present research is devoted to the development of functional nanostructured materials for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. The developed systems include novel morphologies of transparent conducting oxides, synthesis approaches to fabricate ultrasmall metal oxide nanoparticles for efficient energy conversion and storage, and hierarchical titania morphologies for solar cells, photocatalysis, and electrochemical energy storage.</p>
