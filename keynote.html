  <p class="body">At the end of 1994 Olaf concluded his PhD at the University of Heidelberg with Prof. G. Huttner. Then he joined the Bertini group in Florence until March 1997. Afterwards he worked at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (today: KIT) in the field of catalysis and process development where  in 2000 he was awarded with a permanent position. In 2011 he moved to the JRC-Karlsruhe (formerly: ITU) where since 2013 he is employed as research official in the field of syntheses and characterisation. His research interests are the complex and organometallic chemistry of the actinides, and their application towards the synthesis of nano-sized materials. He is (co-)author of ca 140 journal contributions.  </p>
