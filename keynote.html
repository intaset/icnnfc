  <p class="body">George Palasantzas was born in Amfikleia (Greece) and studied Physics at the <i>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</i> in Greece from 1984-1988. He obtained Fulbright fellowship and completed his MSc at Northeastern University in USA from 1989-1991, and subsequently his PhD with a Prof. J. Krim from 1991-1994. From 1994-1996 he did obligatory military service in Greece, and after PostDoc at TUDelft from 1996-1998 in the NEXT Laboratory (Nanophysics). From 1998-2000 he was PostDoc and NIMR/Groningen. From 2001-2014 worked as University Lecturer at the University of Groningen. From 2010-2013 he was the chairman of the ESF RNP CASIMIR. From 2014-present he was promoted to Professor in Physics. His current research interests are in Nanoscale roughness, Casimir effect and surface interactions, and Nanoparticle Physics (Energy storage, wetting, solar cells). He teaches Mathematical Physics (1 year) and Electronics (2 and 3 years).</p>

  <p class="body">Dina Fattakhova-Rohlfing has obtained her education in chemistry at the Kazan State University, and has completed her Ph.D. degree in electrochemistry at the A. Arbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry in Kazan, Russian Federation in 1994. She worked afterward as a research scientist in academic institutes in Prague (J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry), Bordeaux (National School of Chemistry and Physics), and Hannover (University of Hannover). Since 2006 she works as a lecturer and since 2012 as a professor for the international master’s program Advanced Materials Science (AMS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich (LMU), Germany. She works in an interdisciplinary field combining electrochemistry and materials chemistry. Her present research is devoted to the development of functional nanostructured materials for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. The developed systems include novel morphologies of transparent conducting oxides, synthesis approaches to fabricate ultrasmall metal oxide nanoparticles for efficient energy conversion and storage, and hierarchical titania morphologies for solar cells, photocatalysis, and electrochemical energy storage.</p>
