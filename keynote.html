  <p class="body">Dr Dmitry Bavykin is Associate Professor Energy Technology within Engineering and the Environment at the University of Southampton.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Dmitry Bavykin is a specialist in the area of nanomaterials and photocatalysis with more than 20 years experience of research and problem solving using a variety of scientific techniques. He was awarded a one year Royal Society/NATO Fellowship for posdoctoral studies in 2002 for undertaking research in Bath University. These studies, which were supervised by Professor Frank C. Walsh and Dr Alexei Lapkin, explored the synthesis, characterization and application of nanotubular titanates and TiO2, which have applications in electrochemistry and catalysis. During this time he started to work on the compact reactor systems under supervision of Dr. Pawel Plucinski and Dr Alexei Lapkin.</p>
  <p class="body">His ambition is to use his background in material chemistry and physical chemistry to develop TiO2 (or other) nanotubular based self-assembled systems (thin film electrodes, catalyst coatings) having desired location of different functionalities and use of such system for different energy related modern challenges (hydrogen storage, lithium batteries, solar and fuel cells).</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Multiscale Hierarchical Micro- and Nanostructures: Nanotubes and Micro-Assembly</p>

  <p class="body">Dina Fattakhova-Rohlfing has obtained her education in chemistry at the Kazan State University, and has completed her Ph.D. degree in electrochemistry at the A. Arbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry in Kazan, Russian Federation in 1994. She worked afterward as a research scientist in academic institutes in Prague (J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry), Bordeaux (National School of Chemistry and Physics), and Hannover (University of Hannover). Since 2006 she works as a lecturer and since 2012 as a professor for the international master’s program Advanced Materials Science (AMS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich (LMU), Germany. She works in an interdisciplinary field combining electrochemistry and materials chemistry. Her present research is devoted to the development of functional nanostructured materials for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. The developed systems include novel morphologies of transparent conducting oxides, synthesis approaches to fabricate ultrasmall metal oxide nanoparticles for efficient energy conversion and storage, and hierarchical titania morphologies for solar cells, photocatalysis, and electrochemical energy storage.</p>
