  <p class="body"><strong>Professor Andre Lee, Ph.D.</strong>  Dr. Lee is currently a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the Michigan State University.  He received his Ph.D. degree in Physics/Materials Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1987.  From 1987 to 1989, Dr. Lee worked at the Polymers Division of NIST as a physical scientist where his research included physical aging of polymeric materials and viscoelastic properties characterization using optical methods.  In 1989, he joins the Composite Development Center of Lockheed Corporation as a Senior Scientist to work on carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites for the YF-22 project. He was responsible developing techniques for real-time monitoring of the consolidation processes in thermoplastics polymer matrix composites.  In 1991, he started the academic research in the area of polymeric matrix composite at Michigan State University.  In the past 24 years, his major research activities included the synthesis, manufacturing/processing and characterization of polymers and polymeric matrix composites, the use of nanostructured chemicals to manipulate microstructures of polymers and metals.  He is an expert in the area of design and synthesis of nanostructures to control the solidification events in solids.  Professor Lee has more than 60 published papers, and over 100 national/international presentations. His research group is currently funded by Air Force Research Laboratory, Ford Motor Company, National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research and Semiconductor Research Corporation.  </p>

  <p class="body">Evgeny Rebrov is full professor of Energy Intensified Reactor Engineering in the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick since 2014. He got his PhD in Chemistry from Boreskov Institute of Catalysis (Novosibirsk, Russia) in 1999 and DSc in Chemical Engineering from Lomonosov Moscow University of Fine Chemical Technology in 2012. In 2007 he got a fellowship from the British Council-NWO partnership program in science and went to Cambridge University (UK), where he worked on the synthesis and characterisation of bimetallic nanoparticles. In 2009, he was appointed Visiting Research Professor at Wright State University (Dayton, Ohio). In 2010, he took the position of Chair of Chemical Reactor Engineering at Queen’s University Belfast (UK). </p>
  <p class="body">Over the last 10 years, he has developed a novel platform technology which is offering a new and exciting way to change the landscape of the fine chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes through applications of catalytic coatings in structured reactors. The developed process cuts down on operational costs in plants, and provides an end product of greater purity. In 2016, he established the company, StoliCatalysts Ltd. </p>
  <p class="body">Prof. Evgeny Rebrov is Fellow of the Young Academy of Europe (YAE) and corresponding member of the Scientific Council for Catalysis at the Department of Chemistry and Materials Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is member of international scientific committees of three international conferences. Evgeny has published more than 150 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals and provided 15 key-note and plenary lectures at international scientific conferences. </p>
